            Whilst I have been analysing the difficulties someone with tetraplegia
            may face in their mobility, I have been examining some existing products
            that are currently avaible that aid with mobility. By doing so I aim
            to formulate design requirements for an assistive device.

                The <a href="https://www.millercare.co.uk/q700-m-sedeo-ergo-mid-wheel-powerchair/">
                Quickie Q700</a>, one of the more expensive wheelchairs at £21 000.
                This is most likely due to its impressive standing function, the chair
                extends upwards at an 85˚ angle lifting the sitter into a standing
                position. Not only does this allow them to access higher areas, but
                it alleviates pressure. There are six programmable positions available
                at the push of a button which enables further pressure alleviation.

                The <a href="http://www.sheenmobility.co.uk/shop-full-width/wheelchairs/self-propelled-wheelchairs/id-soft-self-propel-wheelchair/">
                ID Soft</a> features a high level of adjustability at a relatively
                low pricepoint although it is not powered. Backrest, seat angle and
                leg rest elevation are all easily adjustable by another user. The
                seat is deep and concaved with an adjustable headrest that would
                aid in helping posture.

                The <a href="https://www.ottobock-export.com/en/mobility-solutions/complex/power-wheelchairs/a200/">
                Ottobock A200</a> is listed as an indoor chair due to its narrow
                width. It is modular and foldable so it can easily be broken down
                and transported elsewhere. This is interesting as many of the chairs
                I have viewed are quite bulky and heavy and would likely require
                specialised transport for longer distances, this portability would
                allow for more freedom. There is a payoff for this however as the
                seat features less adjustability the other models.

                The <a href="https://www.premiere-healthcare.co.uk/products/kirton-duo-major-minor-chairs/">
                Kirton Duo</a> is a not used for mobility but does feature posture
                adjustability functions that are worth recognising. In addition
                to the large amounts of padding, it has larger angles of adjustability
                meaning there are is greater range of positioning for pressure alleviation.
                The back of the chair is a rib like structure with a large range
                of adjustability which can support any posture. The chair is very
                large so would be unfeasable to be adapted into a wheelchair.

                Dynamic cushions</a> are sometimes used for people at medium to high
                risk of developing pressure ulcers. The linked model operates by
                alterneting the pressure across the cushion by inflating or deflating
                its sections whilst on a timer, therefore pressure is alternatingly
                reduced in a cycle.

                Static</a> pressure relief cushions are a cheaper alternative to
                dynamic ones as mention before. More likely recommended for use
                for people at lower risk of developing pressure ulcers. It works
                by spreading pressure evenly around the sitter using soft materials
                either in a gel or foam form which is the case for the product shown.
