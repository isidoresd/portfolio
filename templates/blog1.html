          <p>According to the <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/wheelchair-services/">
            National Health Service</a>, there are 1.2 million wheelchair users in the UK alone,
            a striking 1.8% of the population. The International Spinal Cord
            Society estimates that as of 2019, at least
            <a href=
            "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333069735_Understanding_and_
            modelling_the_economic_impact_of_spinal_cord_injuries_in_the_United_Kingdom
            ">1200</a>
            new people suffer from some kind of spinal cord injuries every year
            with 35% of these causing teraplegia, a severe form of paralysis.</p>

          <p>Tetraplegia (often reffered to as quadriplegia) is caused by damage
            to the spinal cord or brain known as lesions. Lesions can be the result
            of trauma, such as injury, diseases such as multiple sclerosis, or
            congenital disorders such as muscular dystrophy. The large majority
            of cases being caused by trauma according to the <a href=
            "https://www.nscisc.uab.edu/Public/Facts%20and%20Figures%202020.pdf"
            >National Spinal Cord Injury Statistcal Center</a>. Spinal injuries are
            categorised determined by where the spinal cord is damaged, the
            further up the spine the damage occurs, the higher the severity of the
            paralysis. Seperated into cervical segments, from C8 damage being
            the least severe, to C1 being the most. A person with C1 injuries
            require aid even to breathe whereas persons with C8 injuries are capable
            of using self-propelled wheelchairs.</p>

          <p>A wheelchair is an essential aid for someone living with tetraplegia.
            By using them, someone with tetraplegia or any other form of paralysis
            or debilitating conditions, is able to live an active life. Wheelchairs
            are used extensively throughout the day and a user could be sitting
            in one for several hours at a time. This can cause problems as we will
            examine in a future blog post.</p>

          <p>If you were to need a wheelchair, would you want it to look nice?
            Often when reading the news, one comes across articles on the latest
            developments in prosthesis. These prosthesis are often examples of
            exceptional design both in terms of its engineering and aesthetics.
            But when viewing wheelchairs, it becomes apparent that they do not
            recieve nearly as much design interest. Their design does not appear
            to have noticeably changed in decades. It is time that wheelchairs
            got an update.</p>
